Here is the complete **English translation** of points 10, 11, and 12 of your project/report requirements:

---

### **10)**

The IEEE conference template must be used for the report (you are expected to submit the **.docx version**).
Those who wish may write their report using **LaTeX via Overleaf**. In this case, **editing access** must be granted to **[urhanh@gmail.com](mailto:urhanh@gmail.com)**.

The **report file name** must follow this format:
**StudentName\_ID.docx**
Example: `ZeynepKilimci_142354.docx`

---

### **11)**

The project report must include:

* **Data collection and data cleaning**:
  This section will also be submitted **as a separate, detailed midterm report** on the system.
  However, the part you were responsible for in the midterm must also be included again in the final report.

* **Explanation of the models used**, each under its **own subheading**.

* A **Results** section that:

  * Presents all results obtained for each model.
  * Does **not** use screenshots. Instead, **present results in tables**.
  * **Every result must be interpreted**.

* **All figures required** in the original instructions must be included.

* Include **data visualizations before and after cleaning**, along with **descriptive explanations**.

---

### **12)**

Your project must be implemented in **Python using Google Colab**.

You must share your entire project via **Google Drive**, including:

* code,
* experiment result visuals,
* outcomes,
* dataset,
* dataset visualizations, etc.

This shared folder must be **accessible to [urhanh@gmail.com](mailto:urhanh@gmail.com)**.
**The sharing links must be included in your project report**.
**Any project without links in the report or without proper sharing access will not be graded.**

Would you like me to provide the IEEE .docx template or help draft an outline for your report in that format?
